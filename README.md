## Summary ##
Game Design: Created prototype of a **Multiplayer Online First Person Shooter** game using Unity and Photon for Unity.


## Game Objectives ##
- The game is divided into two teams: **Intruders** and **Defenders**. 
  - Intruders' objective is to collect a certain amount of fruits before time runs out.
  - Defenders' objective is to protect the fruits from being collected by the Intruders.

## Game Mechanics ##
 - Players have a health bar that directly depends on the amount of fruits they have collected.
 - If a player's fruit count reaches 0, they will be temporarily knocked out, disabled, or inactive for a set period of time, for example, 30 seconds.
 - Players can be revived if their teammates give them at least 10 fruits within a set time frame, for example, 10 seconds.
 - Players can collect fruits from trees and the ground using a Fruit Gravitron, a sci-fi styled gun that operates like a gravity gun.
 - Players can shoot fruits at opposing players to disable them.
 - Each fruit type can make different damage, for example, Apples: moderate damage, Pineapples: moderate damage with a chance of knockdown effect on the player.
 - If a player is shot, the player will lose their existing fruits dropping to the ground. Those fruits can be recollected by either team players.

**Fruit Gravitron Gun**
The Fruit Gravitron is a powerful and versatile weapon that operates like a gravity gun. It allows players to collect fruits from a distance, resize them when they reach the barrel of the gun and resize them back to their original size while shooting these fruits.
